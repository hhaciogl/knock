Knock is a simplification of the Test Anything Protocol used by Perl and others.

Every test suite is a script that prints lines looking like:

  ok ...        for a passed test
  not ok ...    for a failed test
  # ...         for diagnostics

Everything else is ignored.  Scripts should exit with 0 when they ran
all tests and non-0 when there was a fatal error.
